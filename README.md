### Troubleshooting
If the configuration you're entering from Popcorntime does not seem to work try changing the port number on both Popcorn Time and Microwave.

Otherwise make sure the used ports are open on your network and that the ip that displays in Popcorn Time is the correct ip for your computer in the network.
